                <p>We did it, team. We made a website. I say we because I definitely did not
                make this thing alone.</p>
                
                <p>This site was made possible with the help of a countless number of people in the
                form of open-source libraries, tutorials, StackOverflow Q&amp;A, technical books,
                and so forth. I know that this site isn&rsquo;t winning any Turing awards, but I&rsquo;m
                pretty happy with how it has turned out. Baby&rsquo;s first website, I know, I know.
                There is still plenty of room for improvement and features, but I&rsquo;ll implement
                them as I become more familiar with webdev. I&rsquo;m happy with this as a base though.</p>
                
                <p>Before I settled down with <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> I had played with the idea of
                making an actual blogging application in Rails for my site. I scrapped that idea
                pretty quick. I also tried <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> as well as a plain
                <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> site, but wasn&rsquo;t crazy about either of them. I&rsquo;m sure there
                are approximately one <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/static_website_generation">jigglybillion</a> other static site generators that
                I completely passed by, but that&rsquo;s alright. I&rsquo;m pretty comfy with Middleman.</p>
                
                <p>Other than Middleman (and a few extensions), I&rsquo;m also using Haml, Sass,
                and pieces of <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>. I realize that aesthetically the site is
                basically just colored-text (call me minimalist) and that technically
                it is more layout, styling and configuration than anything else. Overall,
                though, I&rsquo;m pleased that I can mold this into whatever I want it to be (and,
                by extension, prevent it from becoming something that I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want it to be).</p>
                
                <p>Even if it means that the site just devolves into a red panda gif feed, at least
                I am empowered to do so.</p>
