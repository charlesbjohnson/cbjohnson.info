                  <h3>We did it</h3>
                  <p class='blog-stamp'>
                    <time datetime='2013-08-16 16:18:00 -0400'>Aug 16, 2013</time>
                  </p>
                  <p>We did it, team. We made a website. I say we because I definitely did not
                  make this thing alone.</p>
                  
                  <p>This site was made possible with the help of a countless number of people in the
                  form of open-source libraries, tutorials, StackOverflow Q&amp;A, technical books,
                  and so forth. I know that this site isn't winning any Turing awards, but I'm
                  pretty happy with how it has turned out. Baby's first website, I know, I know.
                  There is still plenty of room for improvement and features, but I'll implement
                  them as I become more familiar with webdev. I'm happy with this as a base though.</p>
                  
                  <p>Before I settled down with <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> I had played with the idea of
                  making an actual blogging application in Rails for my site. I scrapped that idea
                  pretty quick. I also tried <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> as well as a plain
                  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> site, but wasn't crazy about either of them. I'm sure there
                  are approximately one <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/static_website_generation\">jigglybillion</a> other static site generators that
                  I completely passed by, but that's alright. I'm pretty comfy with Middleman.</p>
                  
                  <p>Other than Middleman (and a few extensions), I'm also using Haml, Sass,
                  and pieces of <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>. I realize that aesthetically the site is
                  basically just colored-text (call me minimalist) and that technically
                  it is more layout, styling and configuration than anything else. Overall,
                  though I'm pleased that I can mold this into whatever I want it to be (and,
                  by extension, prevent it from becoming something that I <em>don't</em> want it to be).</p>
                  
                  <p>Even if it means that the site just devolves into a red panda gif feed, at least
                  I am empowered to do so.</p>
