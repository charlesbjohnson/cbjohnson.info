              <p>It's been a while since I've last written anything so I figured it was time
              for a status update.</p>
              
              <p>At this point in time I think I've become fairly proficient with Ruby. I've read
              a few books now (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1933988657/">The Well-Grounded Rubyist</a>,
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321584104/">Eloquent Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-RSpec-Book-Behaviour-Development/dp/1934356379/">The RSpec Book</a>) and I feel that I can dive
              into projects and find my way around without getting completely lost in the process.
              Case and point, I recently finished up another iteration of my, <em>aherm</em>, passion
              project <a href="https://gotobell.herokuapp.com/">Go To Bell</a>.</p>
              
              <p>It also helps, though, that Go To Bell is pretty simple project (for now
              at least). It just scrapes Taco Bell's menu, stores it, and presents random
              combinations of the newly stored menu data. There aren't a ton of moving parts
              either. I used Postgres, <a href="http://sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a>, <a href="http://www.padrinorb.com/">Padrino</a>, Nokogiri, RSpec,
              <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">Susy</a>, Haml and Sass. Simple, nothing truly groundbreaking.</p>
              
              <p>What made it a challenge, though, was that it was a complete web app from
              start to finish where I tried to use some libraries that would be a little
              bit less 'batteries included'. Not to say I'm a hardcore programmer who uses
              only magnets to get his work done, but I'm somewhat proud that I was able to
              work with some Ruby libraries that were less ubiquitous than Rails and yet still
              figure it out. I feel like that's the essential experience of being a
              programmer; being able to take a few things you know only a little about, some
              documentation (or sometimes just the source), time, and effort and be able to
              combine them all into something useful (or something that's maybe not
              really that useful, but fun nonetheless).</p>
              
              <p>Not to mention, I picked up some JavaScript along the way (although the app uses
              very little and its mostly just jQuery). Since I hate using a language when I
              know nothing about it, I went through a few JavaScript books too
              (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/">Javascript: The Good Parts</a>,
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/1118026691/">Professional JavaScript For Web Developers</a>,
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Maintainable-JavaScript-Nicholas-C-Zakas/dp/1449327680/">Maintainable JavaScript</a>). I'm less in the know when it comes to
              the JavaScript world than I am with the Ruby one, but I also feel way more
              confident with it than I was before. Enough so that I can appreciate its
              strengths while also avoiding some of its pitfalls.</p>
              
              <p>Anyway, if you've read this far then chances are you've come for a red panda gif.
              Since I'd hate to be a disappointment…</p>
