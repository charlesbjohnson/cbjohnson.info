                <p>Technical interviews are rough. It&rsquo;s great when you do well (or at least
                when you think you do) but more often than not I have a hard time with them.
                Having to sit in a room and take an exam with one or more people
                staring you down just isn&rsquo;t a very enjoyable experience. Even
                when you know all the answers, it still sucks.</p>
                
                <p>I spent a spent a very long amount of time trying to figure out what the secret
                was to getting better at interviews. At first I thought that I didn&rsquo;t perform
                well at technical questions because I missed out on learning CS fundamentals.
                So I went through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI">Algorithms I</a> on
                Coursera. Although I didn&rsquo;t do every single piece of content made available in
                the course, I did watch and rewatch every video from the series and implemented
                a majority of the algorithms and data structures I learned about. The course
                was great but by the end of it all it felt like it was just a big refresher.
                In other words, it meant that I probably wasn&rsquo;t missing some fundamental
                portion of CS knowledge I needed for interviews.</p>
                
                <p>So if it wasn&rsquo;t my education to blame for my inadequacy at technical questions,
                then does that mean I&rsquo;m just stupid? Not exactly (I hope!). After taking the
                refresher course, I then looked to interview prep books.
                <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>, in particular. I thought that
                maybe there was a technique to solving these kinds of problems that I was
                completely unaware of. So I went through the book and started answering the
                questions. I made a <a href="https://github.com/charlesbjohnson/cracking_the_coding_interview">repo</a> dedicated to the whole process. It was
                all done in Ruby and there are tests and everything (530 of them). I haven&rsquo;t
                done every single problem but I have done quite a lot of them.</p>
                
                <p>I&rsquo;ve done enough problems to conclude that it&rsquo;s all pretty bogus. For some
                questions there is a definite pattern. There are some &lsquo;tricks&rsquo; you end up using
                to solve more than one problem. But they are pretty insignificant. At the start
                of each chapter the author outlines a general technique that you should
                use to solve the class of problems contained in the chapter, whether it be
                about dynamic programming, something about linked lists, or whatever else.
                More often than not, though, the advice is just too vague or generic to be useful.</p>
                
                <p>Take the chapter on Mathematics and Probability, for example. The intro talks
                about how all numbers can be decomposed into products of primes, how you can
                check if a number is prime, and some stuff about probability. All useful stuff
                in their own right. But useful for solving the problems? Not a chance. I
                honestly couldn&rsquo;t figure out the solutions to several problems in that chapter.
                But that wasn&rsquo;t even the disappointing part. The disappointing part came when
                I finally gave in and reached for a clue from the solutions only to find that
                there are no clues. There&rsquo;s no particularly useful insight into solving the
                problem. It just feels like you either know nothing about how to solve the
                problem or you know exactly how to do it. There&rsquo;s no middle ground. And it&rsquo;s
                not that the solutions are incomprehensible, either. It&rsquo;s that I can&rsquo;t see how
                you could ever deduce the solution without already knowing it ahead of time.</p>
                
                <p>So the secret to technical questions like these is that there is no secret.
                Some techniques lend themselves to solving certain problems but, more often
                than not, your ability to solve a problem is best predicted by the number of
                other similarly arbitrary problems you&rsquo;ve already solved.</p>
                
                <p>Who knows. Maybe there are people who can take one look at these kinds of
                problems, even in an interview setting when they&rsquo;ve never seen anything
                similar before, and manage to formulate a solution out of nothing. Maybe
                there is a framework to solving these problems that I still haven&rsquo;t figured
                out. If there is then I&rsquo;d love to hear about it. If you are like me, though,
                then you are better off just practicing. Don&rsquo;t waste time and effort doubting
                your ability. Have some confidence in yourself and just work the problems out
                as best as you can. That&rsquo;s how you can &lsquo;crack the coding interview&rsquo;.</p>
