                <p class='blog-stamp'>
                  <time datetime='2013-12-02 18:14:00 -0500'>Dec  2, 2013</time>
                </p>
              </header>
              <p>So I&rsquo;ve just wrapped up setting up code formatting for this blog and to put
              it to the test I&rsquo;ve decided I would write about something that has been an
              ongoing problem with this project, until now. That topic is&hellip; Blog images!</p>
              
              <p>Middleman has a <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging/">blogging</a> module that is great. I&rsquo;ve
              been using it since I started this project and it has been fine. Though there
              are a ton of features in middleman-blog that I&rsquo;m not even using, there is one
              in particular that has been absolutely vital. Without it there wouldn&rsquo;t be any
              fantastic red panda gifs to leisurely view. I&rsquo;m referring to <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging/#toc_14">article
              subdirectories</a> of course.</p>
              
              <p>Article subdirectories allow me to group my red panda images with the blog
              post that they debut in. Obviously, this &lsquo;everything in its place&rsquo; approach is
              extremely appealing to my OCD nature. On a more serious note, though, it also
              allows for relative links to the image (or file). This is very useful since
              it is tedious having to write out the entire absolute path for an image. In
              addition, if one day I decide I need multiple images for a single post
              then having to write out each absolute path will also lead to redundancy.</p>
              
              <p>The problem with article subdirectories and relative links, however, is that
              it doesn&rsquo;t work well with another feature of Middleman,
              <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/basics/pretty-urls/">directory indexes</a>. Directory indexes allow for cruft-free URLs
              (which is also a must-have feature for the obsessive). As I already mentioned, it
              <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/basics/pretty-urls/#toc_1">does</a> not <a href="https://github.com/middleman/middleman/issues/818">work</a> with relative links. So you
              end up having to use absolute links anyway. To compensate for this shortcoming,
              I process my markdown blog posts in ERB first so that I can also use a simple
              little helper method which gets the absolute file path of an image I want to
              use. It looks like this (<code>helpers/blog_image_helpers.rb</code>)</p>
              <pre class="highlight ruby"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><div class="lineno">1</div><div class="lineno">2</div><div class="lineno">3</div><div class="lineno">4</div><div class="lineno">5</div><div class="lineno">6</div><div class="lineno">7</div><div class="lineno">8</div><div class="lineno">9</div><div class="lineno">10</div><div class="lineno">11</div><div class="lineno">12</div></td><td class="code"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;find&#39;</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">BlogImageHelpers</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;  <span class="k">def </span><span class="nf">blog_image</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">image</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;    <span class="n">images</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Find</span><span class="nf">.find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;source/blog&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">.grep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">image</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sr">/</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">images</span><span class="nf">.empty?</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;    <span class="n">images</span><span class="nf">.first</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="sr">/\/blog.+/</span><span class="o">]</span>&#x000A;  <span class="k">end</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="k">end</span>&#x000A;</td></tr></tbody></table></pre>
              <p>Pretty simple. When coupled with a markdown link like this:</p>
              <pre class="highlight erb"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><div class="lineno">1</div></td><td class="code">![some image](<span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">blog_image</span> <span class="s1">&#39;image.gif&#39;</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span> &quot;wow a gif&quot;)&#x000A;</td></tr></tbody></table></pre>
              <p>It produces:</p>
              <pre class="highlight markdown"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><div class="lineno">1</div></td><td class="code"><span class="p">![</span><span class="nv">some image</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="sx">/blog/2013/12/02-some-post/image.gif</span> <span class="nn">&quot;wow a gif&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;</td></tr></tbody></table></pre>
              <p>And that&rsquo;s good enough for Middleman to figure out the rest.</p>
              
              <h4>But wait! There are more problems!</h4>
              
              <p>If you end up trying something similar to my own blog where you have individual
              blog posts as well as an index of blog posts, you will run into another
              problem. Middleman can&rsquo;t link to an image that is sitting in an article
              subdirectory from a page that is NOT that blog post. In my case, that meant that
              links to images on my blog index (at <code>/blog</code>) were incorrect.
              Links to images from a specific blog post
              (like <code>/blog/2013/12/some-post</code>) where that image actually appears,
              however, were totally fine.</p>
              
              <p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to look into Middleman&rsquo;s source to see what it&rsquo;s trying to
              do here, but my guess is that this is a bug. Even though we give an absolute
              URL to an image in our markdown article, Middleman still builds it as a
              relative link. So the image link in the markdown I previously mentioned would
              actually be built as:</p>
              <pre class="highlight html"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><div class="lineno">1</div></td><td class="code"><span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">title=</span><span class="s">&quot;wow a gif&quot;</span> <span class="na">alt=</span><span class="s">&quot;some image&quot;</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;image.gif&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>&#x000A;</td></tr></tbody></table></pre>
              <p>No absolute path anywhere in sight! Where did it go!?! This may work for the
              actual blog post page at <code>/blog/2013/12/some-post</code>, but it
              definitely doesn&rsquo;t work for the blog index page at <code>/blog</code>.</p>
              
              <p>Fortunately, there is a simple fix. Disable <code>relative_assets</code> in
              your <code>config.rb</code>.</p>
              <pre class="highlight ruby"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><div class="lineno">1</div><div class="lineno">2</div><div class="lineno">3</div><div class="lineno">4</div><div class="lineno">5</div></td><td class="code"><span class="c1"># Build-specific configuration</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">configure</span> <span class="ss">:build</span> <span class="k">do</span>&#x000A;  <span class="c1"># Use relative URLs</span>&#x000A;  <span class="c1">#activate :relative_assets</span>&#x000A;<span class="k">end</span>&#x000A;</td></tr></tbody></table></pre>
              <p>With that change, my links were processed absolutely and built as:</p>
              <pre class="highlight html"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><div class="lineno">1</div></td><td class="code"><span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">title=</span><span class="s">&quot;wow a gif&quot;</span> <span class="na">alt=</span><span class="s">&quot;some image&quot;</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;/blog/2013/12/some-post/image.gif&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>&#x000A;</td></tr></tbody></table></pre>
              <p>Afterwards, make sure any other assets are using absolute paths. So for me that
              meant making sure my application stylesheet and javascript from my default
              layout (<code>source/layouts/layout.rb</code>) needed to become:</p>
              <pre class="highlight haml"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><div class="lineno">1</div><div class="lineno">2</div><div class="lineno">3</div><div class="lineno">4</div><div class="lineno">5</div></td><td class="code"><span class="nt">%head</span>&#x000A;  ...&#x000A;  <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">stylesheet_link_tag</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/stylesheets/application&#39;</span>&#x000A;  <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">javascript_include_tag</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/javascripts/application&#39;</span>&#x000A;  ...&#x000A;</td></tr></tbody></table></pre>
              <p>And that&rsquo;s it! Now I&rsquo;ve got images working across the blog. Glorious red panda
              filled images everywhere. Interspersed with wondrous code snippets.</p>

              <p>Technical interviews are rough. It&rsquo;s great when you do well (or at least
              when you think you do) but more often than not I have a hard time with them.
              Having to sit in a room and take an exam with one or more people
              staring you down just isn&rsquo;t a very enjoyable experience. Even
              when you know all the answers, it still sucks.</p>
              
              <p>I spent a spent a very long amount of time trying to figure out what the secret
              was to getting better at interviews. At first I thought that I didn&rsquo;t perform
              well at technical questions because I missed out on learning CS fundamentals.
              So I went through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI">Algorithms I</a> on
              Coursera. Although I didn&rsquo;t do every single piece of content made available in
              the course, I did watch and rewatch every video from the series and implemented
              a majority of the algorithms and data structures I learned about. The course
              was great but by the end of it all it felt like it was just a big refresher.
              In other words, it meant that I probably wasn&rsquo;t missing some fundamental
              portion of CS knowledge I needed for interviews.</p>
              
              <p>So if it wasn&rsquo;t my education to blame for my inadequacy at technical questions,
              then does that mean I&rsquo;m just stupid? Not exactly (I hope!). After taking the
              refresher course, I then looked to interview prep books.
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>, in particular. I thought that
              maybe there was a technique to solving these kinds of problems that I was
              completely unaware of. So I went through the book and started answering the
              questions. I made a <a href="https://github.com/charlesbjohnson/cracking_the_coding_interview">repo</a> dedicated to the whole process. It was
              all done in Ruby and there are tests and everything (530 of them). I haven&rsquo;t
              done every single problem but I have done quite a lot of them.</p>
              
              <p>I&rsquo;ve done enough problems to conclude that it&rsquo;s all pretty bogus. For some
              questions there is a definite pattern. There are some &lsquo;tricks&rsquo; you end up using
              to solve more than one problem. But they are pretty insignificant. At the start
              of each chapter the author outlines a general technique that you should
              use to solve the class of problems contained in the chapter, whether it be
              about dynamic programming, something about linked lists, or whatever else.
              More often than not, though, the advice is just too vague or generic to be useful.</p>
              
              <p>Take the chapter on Mathematics and Probability, for example. The intro talks
              about how all numbers can be decomposed into products of primes, how you can
              check if a number is prime, and some stuff about probability. All useful stuff
              in their own right. But useful for solving the problems? Not a chance. I
              honestly couldn&rsquo;t figure out the solutions to several problems in that chapter.
              But that wasn&rsquo;t even the disappointing part. The disappointing part came when
              I finally gave in and reached for a clue from the solutions only to find that
              there are no clues. There&rsquo;s no particularly useful insight into solving the
              problem. It just feels like you either know nothing about how to solve the
              problem or you know exactly how to do it. There&rsquo;s no middle ground. And it&rsquo;s
              not that the solutions are incomprehensible, either. It&rsquo;s that I can&rsquo;t see how
              you could ever deduce the solution without already knowing it ahead of time.</p>
              
              <p>So the secret to technical questions like these is that there is no secret.
              Some techniques lend themselves to solving certain problems but, more often
              than not, your ability to solve a problem is best predicted by the number of
              other similarly arbitrary problems you&rsquo;ve already solved.</p>
              
              <p>Who knows. Maybe there are people who can take one look at these kinds of
              problems, even in an interview setting when they&rsquo;ve never seen anything
              similar before, and manage to formulate a solution out of nothing. Maybe
              there is a framework to solving these problems that I still haven&rsquo;t figured
              out. If there is then I&rsquo;d love to hear about it. If you are like me, though,
              then you are better off just practicing. Don&rsquo;t waste time and effort doubting
              your ability. Have some confidence in yourself and just work the problems out
              as best as you can. That&rsquo;s how you can &lsquo;crack the coding interview&rsquo;.</p>

              <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve last written anything so I figured it was time
              for a status update.</p>
              
              <p>At this point in time I think I&rsquo;ve become fairly proficient with Ruby. I&rsquo;ve read
              a few books now (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1933988657/">The Well-Grounded Rubyist</a>,
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321584104/">Eloquent Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-RSpec-Book-Behaviour-Development/dp/1934356379/">The RSpec Book</a>) and I feel that I can dive
              into projects and find my way around without getting completely lost in the process.
              Case and point, I recently finished up another iteration of my, <em>aherm</em>, passion
              project <a href="https://gotobell.herokuapp.com/">Go To Bell</a>.</p>
              
              <p>It also helps, though, that Go To Bell is pretty simple project (for now
              at least). It just scrapes Taco Bell&rsquo;s menu, stores it, and presents random
              combinations of the newly stored menu data. There aren&rsquo;t a ton of moving parts
              either. I used Postgres, <a href="http://sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a>, <a href="http://www.padrinorb.com/">Padrino</a>, Nokogiri, RSpec,
              <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">Susy</a>, Haml and Sass. Simple, nothing truly groundbreaking.</p>
              
              <p>What made it a challenge, though, was that it was a complete web app from
              start to finish where I tried to use some libraries that would be a little
              bit less &lsquo;batteries included&rsquo;. Not to say I&rsquo;m a hardcore programmer who uses
              only magnets to get his work done, but I&rsquo;m somewhat proud that I was able to
              work with some Ruby libraries that were less ubiquitous than Rails and yet still
              figure it out. I feel like that&rsquo;s the essential experience of being a
              programmer; being able to take a few things you know only a little about, some
              documentation (or sometimes just the source), time, and effort and be able to
              combine them all into something useful (or something that&rsquo;s maybe not
              really that useful, but fun nonetheless).</p>
              
              <p>Not to mention, I picked up some JavaScript along the way (although the app uses
              very little and its mostly just jQuery). Since I hate using a language when I
              know nothing about it, I went through a few JavaScript books too
              (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/">Javascript: The Good Parts</a>,
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/1118026691/">Professional JavaScript For Web Developers</a>,
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Maintainable-JavaScript-Nicholas-C-Zakas/dp/1449327680/">Maintainable JavaScript</a>). I&rsquo;m less in the know when it comes to
              the JavaScript world than I am with the Ruby one, but I also feel way more
              confident with it than I was before. Enough so that I can appreciate its
              strengths while also avoiding some of its pitfalls.</p>

              Since I&rsquo;d hate to be a disappointment&hellip;</p>
