              <p class='blog-stamp'>
                <time datetime='2013-10-22 18:59:00 -0400'>Oct 22, 2013</time>
              </p>
              <p>It's been a while since I've last written anything so I figured it was time
              for a status update.</p>
              
              <p>At this point in time I think I've become fairly proficient with Ruby. I've read
              a few books now (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1933988657/">The Well-Grounded Rubyist</a>,
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321584104/">Eloquent Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-RSpec-Book-Behaviour-Development/dp/1934356379/">The RSpec Book</a>) and I feel that I can dive
              into projects and find my way around without getting completely lost in the process.
              Case and point, I recently finished up another iteration of my, aherm, passion
              project <a href="https://gotobell.herokuapp.com/">Go To Bell</a>.</p>
              
              <p>It also helps, though, that Go To Bell is pretty simple project (for now
              at least). It just scrapes Taco Bell's menu, stores it, and presents random
              combinations of the newly stored menu data. There aren't a ton of moving parts
              either. I used Postgres, <a href="http://sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a>, <a href="http://www.padrinorb.com/">Padrino</a>, Nokogiri, RSpec,
              <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">Susy</a>, Haml and Sass. Simple, nothing truly groundbreaking.</p>
              
              <p>What made it a challenge, though, was that it was a complete web app from
              start to finish where I tried to use some libraries that would be a little
              bit less 'batteries included'. Not to say I'm a hardcore programmer who uses
              only magnets to get his work done, but I'm somewhat proud that I was able to
              work with some Ruby libraries that were less ubiquitous than Rails yet still
              figure it out. I feel like that's the essential experience of being a
              programmer; being able to take a few things you know only a little about, some
              documentation (or sometimes just the source), time, and effort and be able to
              magically combine them all into something useful (or something that's maybe not
              really that useful, but fun nonetheless).</p>
              
              <p>Not to mention, I picked up some JavaScript along the way (although the app uses
              very little and its mostly just jQuery). Since I hate using a language when I
              know nothing about it, I went through a few JavaScript books too
              (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/">Javascript: The Good Parts</a>,
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/1118026691/">Professional JavaScript For Web Developers</a>,
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Maintainable-JavaScript-Nicholas-C-Zakas/dp/1449327680/">Maintainable JavaScript</a>). I'm less in the know when it comes to
              the JavaScript world than I am with the Ruby one, but I also feel way more
              confident with it than I was before. Enough so that I can appreciate its
              strengths while also avoiding some of its pitfalls.</p>
              
              <p>Anyway, if you've read this far then chances are you've come for a red panda gif.
              Since I'd hate to be a disappointment…</p>

              <p class='blog-stamp'>
                <time datetime='2013-08-16 16:18:00 -0400'>Aug 16, 2013</time>
              </p>
              <p>We did it, team. We made a website. I say we because I definitely did not
              make this thing alone.</p>
              
              <p>This site was made possible with the help of a countless number of people in the
              form of open-source libraries, tutorials, StackOverflow Q&amp;A, technical books,
              and so forth. I know that this site isn't winning any Turing awards, but I'm
              pretty happy with how it has turned out. Baby's first website, I know, I know.
              There is still plenty of room for improvement and features, but I'll implement
              them as I become more familiar with webdev. I'm happy with this as a base though.</p>
              
              <p>Before I settled down with <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> I had played with the idea of
              making an actual blogging application in Rails for my site. I scrapped that idea
              pretty quick. I also tried <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> as well as a plain
              <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> site, but wasn't crazy about either of them. I'm sure there
              are approximately one <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/static_website_generation\">jigglybillion</a> other static site generators that
              I completely passed by, but that's alright. I'm pretty comfy with Middleman.</p>
              
              <p>Other than Middleman (and a few extensions), I'm also using Haml, Sass,
              and pieces of <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>. I realize that aesthetically the site is
              basically just colored-text (call me minimalist) and that technically
              it is more layout, styling and configuration than anything else. Overall,
              though, I'm pleased that I can mold this into whatever I want it to be (and,
              by extension, prevent it from becoming something that I <em>don't</em> want it to be).</p>
              
              <p>Even if it means that the site just devolves into a red panda gif feed, at least
              I am empowered to do so.</p>

              <p>Here it is, the very first one! This first post is basically just a placeholder.
              I still haven't gotten this site up and running at the time of this writing, but
              when I do I'll write up something about who I am as well as how and why I created
              this site/blog.</p>
