We did it, team. We made a website. I say we because I definitely did not
make this thing alone.

This site was made possible with the help of a countless number of people in the
form of open-source libraries, tutorials, StackOverflow Q&A, technical books,
and so forth. I know that this site isn't winning any Turing awards, but I'm
pretty happy with how it has turned out. Baby's first website, I know, I know.
There is still plenty of room for improvement and features, but I'll implement
them as I become more familiar with webdev. I'm happy with this as a base though.

Before I settled down with [Middleman][middleman] I had played with the idea of
making an actual blogging application in Rails for my site. I scrapped that idea
pretty quick. I also tried [Octopress][octopress] as well as a plain
[Jekyll][jekyll] site, but wasn't crazy about either of them. I'm sure there
are approximately one [jigglybillion][generators] other static site generators that
I completely passed by, but that's alright. I'm pretty comfy with Middleman.

Other than Middleman (and a few extensions), I'm also using Haml, Sass,
and pieces of [Foundation][foundation]. I realize that aesthetically the site is
basically just colored-text (call me minimalist) and that technically
it is more layout, styling and configuration than anything else. Overall,
though, I'm pleased that I can mold this into whatever I want it to be (and,
by extension, prevent it from becoming something that I *don't* want it to be).

Even if it means that the site just devolves into a red panda gif feed, at least
I am empowered to do so.
