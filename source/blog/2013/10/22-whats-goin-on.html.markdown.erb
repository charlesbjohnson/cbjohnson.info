preview: What I've been working on

It's been a while since I've last written anything so I figured it was time
for a status update.

At this point in time I think I've become fairly proficient with Ruby. I've read
a few books now ([The Well-Grounded Rubyist][well-grounded],
[Eloquent Ruby][eloquent], [The RSpec Book][rspec]) and I feel that I can dive
into projects and find my way around without getting completely lost in the process.
Case and point, I recently finished up another iteration of my, *aherm*, passion
project [Go To Bell][gotobell].

It also helps, though, that Go To Bell is pretty simple project (for now
at least). It just scrapes Taco Bell's menu, stores it, and presents random
combinations of the newly stored menu data. There aren't a ton of moving parts
either. I used Postgres, [Sequel][sequel], [Padrino][padrino], Nokogiri, RSpec,
[Susy][susy], Haml and Sass. Simple, nothing truly groundbreaking.

What made it a challenge, though, was that it was a complete web app from
start to finish where I tried to use some libraries that would be a little
bit less 'batteries included'. Not to say I'm a hardcore programmer who uses
only magnets to get his work done, but I'm somewhat proud that I was able to
work with some Ruby libraries that were less ubiquitous than Rails and yet still
figure it out. I feel like that's the essential experience of being a
programmer; being able to take a few things you know only a little about, some
documentation (or sometimes just the source), time, and effort and be able to
combine them all into something useful (or something that's maybe not
really that useful, but fun nonetheless).

Not to mention, I picked up some JavaScript along the way (although the app uses
very little and its mostly just jQuery). Since I hate using a language when I
know nothing about it, I went through a few JavaScript books too
([Javascript: The Good Parts][good-parts],
[Professional JavaScript For Web Developers][pro-js],
[Maintainable JavaScript][maintainable]). I'm less in the know when it comes to
the JavaScript world than I am with the Ruby one, but I also feel way more
confident with it than I was before. Enough so that I can appreciate its
strengths while also avoiding some of its pitfalls.

Anyway, if you've read this far then chances are you've come for a red panda gif.
Since I'd hate to be a disappointment...
