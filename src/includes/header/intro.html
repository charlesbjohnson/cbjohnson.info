    <strong>Hi, I'm Charlie.</strong>
    <br/>

    I'm a full stack web developer who enjoys learning about anything and everything.
    <br/>
    <br class="D(n) D(b)--maxmedium" />

    I care about things like
    the role of open source in and outside of software,
    finding meaningful ways to collaborate,
    and the concise communication of information.
